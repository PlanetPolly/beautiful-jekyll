* When Nobel prizes are awarded, I collect materials and do forecast.

**The teaching assistant of the Honors Course hosted by University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University**

* They are too excellent to turn to a TA for help
* I failed in GSI OET on 08/16/2019. I found in the USA, students may encounter more problems besides understanding course content than students in China.
