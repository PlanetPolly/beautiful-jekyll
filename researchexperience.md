## Research Interests 

Current research interests lie in the field of **Artificial Photosynthesis**, including OER (oxygen evolution reaction), HER (hydrogen evolution reaction, MOR (methanol oxidation reaction), FAOR (formic acid oxidation reaction), etc., as well as their mechanisms in materials' formation, electrochemistry procedures.

## Experience
More detailed than my curriculum vitae
Sometimes I think it's absurd to have such an extensive experience, some professor even just regarded me as a visiting student; I appreciate it because that's how I cross the threshold of doing research.
