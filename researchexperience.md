## Research Interests 

**Artificial photosynthesis, Energy Related Nano Materials, Chemistry of Surface and Interface**

## Experience
*I have conducted research in various fields including biosensors, organic total synthesis, electrocatalysis and interface science. My variety of research experiences have given me a rigorous intuition about combining knowledge from different subfields. This intuition helps me keep an open mind when I encounter problems.*
