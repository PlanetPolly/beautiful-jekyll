## Research Interests 



## Research Experience

### PRP

In the freshmen year, I carried out the first student project on fluorescence probe with another student. It's a student-induced project. Based on some published papers, we designed the probe could connect with some specific saccharide and release a fluorescent part rather than connect and then fluorcent, in order to let the probe tell different kinds of saccharides. Our design worked. It was the first time I did pratical cobphrehensive research on a compound. Drivenly, I self-learned and successfully did some computational analysis, stucture simulation，and made a rational machanism model. In the process, it was fould that this novel complex probe could selectively recognize carbohydrate and hydroxycarboxylic acid compound, further, we fould an exception sodium gluconate, which lacks the fluorescence quenching enhancement effect.

### MoS2

the battery material

### Organic chemistry

I also stayed in an organic lab for about 10 months. After two months' basic training, my work changed to synthesis one kind of spiro compounds by semi-Pinacol rearrangemen，which was the base materials of those seniors' research. But my yield was quite low. Looking through journal websites everyday and consulted others, finally I fould the problem was the tiny water in the system, and the speed I added reagent also matters a lot.

### 2D metal



### Lanthanides

I have an half-year oversea undergraduate research. I had had enough scores for graduation, thus, I personally contacted professors in American Universities, hope to work in their lab for half an year. By hundreds of emails, finally, I grasped the chance to Prof. Hong Yang's lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign (UIUC). Then, to work as a phD candidate, I promised myself. I performed two projects there. The first one on catalysts for fuel cells’ oxygen evolution reaction (OER), cooperate with a phD student. My work is chemical synthesis and OER activity research. At the high positive potentials required for the OER, metals including Pt generally undergo oxidation, which affect the activity and stability of catalyst. Our idea is doping lanthanides to tune the lattice size, and then the whole activity. How interesting the molecule world, the distance less than one nanometer determines its capacity. How to direct the design of functional materials? With discovering of novel activity descriptors (like Noskov's volcano model). Later another project began. I carried it out independently. The research goal was to get high-surface-area Yttrium Ruthenium Oxide (a promising catalyst) in order to improve its performance. After reviewing the literature and discussing with colleagues, I sorted out an idea. I adapted low-temperature synthesis methods because particles would concentrate at high degrees. And I chose the Polymeric Steric Entrapment Method——let PVA entrap metal ions and act as template when annealing, besides, the oxidation of PVA might provide some extra energy in the phase formation. But time is limited for me to accomplish this project. By the time I was back to SJTU, I had not got the aimed phase but synthesized Ruthenium Oxide at a low temperature of 200 degrees. A little depressed, with more time, I would try other gas conditions, other mass-distributed polymers. I'm confident to get the ideal results.
