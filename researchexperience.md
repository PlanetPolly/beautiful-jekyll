## Research Interests 

I plan to delete this page. Well, keep it for a moment.

**Artificial photosynthesis, Energy Related Nano Materials, Chemistry of Surface and Interface**

## Experience
*I have conducted research in various fields including biosensors, organic total synthesis, electrocatalysis and interface science. My variety of research experiences have given me a rigorous intuition about combining knowledge from different subfields. This intuition helps me keep an open mind when I encounter problems.*

*Jan. 2019 — present* <br>
**Graduate student** at **Willard Henry Dow Laboratory** , [Umich](http://umich.edu/)<br>
*Mentored by Prof. [Charles McCrory](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=gFH5HogAAAAJ) on Reductive Desorption of Mixed Self-assembled monolayer*.

* The mismatching between desorption onset potential and turning point of extent change might be caused by the bulky ferrocene-capped tail group, which makes it more likely to leave the surface than decanethiol.
* Applying Cl-terminated thiol instead of Ferrocene-capped thiol. Cl-thiol was synthesized by hydrolysis of thiourea.
* X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the changing extent of Cl-terminated thiol before and after reductive desorption.
* Cl-terminated thiol shows poor solubility in ethanol, hard to form mixed SAMs with decanethiol in ethanol.
* A phase separation occurred in mixed SAMs prepared in chloroform. 
* For SAMs prepared in DCM, it might form an evenly blended phase when χ=0.5.
