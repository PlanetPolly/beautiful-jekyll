## Research Interests 

My current research interests lie in the field of **Artificial Photosynthesis**, including OER (oxygen evolution reaction), HER (hydrogen evolution reaction, MOR (methanol oxidation reaction), FAOR (formic acid oxidation reaction), etc., as well as their mechanisms in materials' formation, electrochemistry procedures.
