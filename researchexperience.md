## Research Interests 

**Artificial photosynthesis, Energy Related Nano Materials, Chemistry of Surface and Interface**

## Experience
More detailed than my curriculum vitae <br>
*Sometimes I think it's absurd to have such an extensive experience, some professor even just regarded me as a visiting student; I appreciate it because that's how I cross the threshold of doing research.*
