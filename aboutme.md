subtitle: There's no one I'd rather be than me.

Hello, I’m Lei Pan, a master student at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), majoring in **Chemistry**. I accomplished my undergraduate study at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I've been a member of **Chemistry Honored Program**, [Zhiyuan College](http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/goto/en). During the third year in undergradute, I went to [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) for half year as a visiting scholar. I have extensive undergraduate research experience, which is just a common step to my academic dream.


### Why me!

My story with chemistry formally started at a magic moment during high school. At that moment I seemed to be touched by some profound logic in chemistry. For instance, although the irreversibility of the 2nd Law of thermodynamics frustrated me, I can alter the energy’s pathway to derive different work from the same initial and final states. It’s an art of process. This kind of thinking not only enhanced my comprehension in Chemistry but also benefited my acquirement of other subjects. I considered this thinking as basis of my excellent performance in high school and in undergraduate. 

During high school, I registered a national high school chemistry contest. To prepare for the contest, I self-learned undergraduate-level inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry. My world of atoms was broadened that an emerging passion made me spare no time on those thick textbooks. When facing an unknown brand-new question, I employed all the accessible aspects to understand and figure out it. It was a good return that I won a great place in the competition, which contributed to my admission to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I chose to major in chemistry, to study the fantastic atomic structures, to solve some substantive problems. That’s my first step in entering the academic society. 

I love chemistry because I love the world of molecules where atoms can be assembled in fantastic new structures. My main research interests focus on developing new fuel cell catalysts, understanding electrochemical processes at interfaces, and designing novel-structured functional nanomaterials. My previous research experiences include developing and characterizing 2-D nanostructured catalysts for fuel cell reactions during my undergraduate research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in China, and studying the reductive desorption properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on metal surfaces in an effort to develop new, more reductively-stable catalyst linkers to surfaces during my Masters research at the University of Michigan (U of M). I am motivated by these projects because of the need to discover more-effective catalysts and stable functional nanostructures that will contribute to solving the energy crisis. My passion for research and its application to real world problems motivates me to apply for a Ph.D. studying nanomaterial for electrocatalysis and energy storage.

**Background of background**:<br>
* I read literary works for 5 hours per week. My favorite writers are Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, Stefan Zweig, George Owell.
* I construct a database to record piece information. Now it has over 320,000 words, varying from professional experiments to coding, even including origami. 
* I acquire fundamental lab skills in organic chemistry, biosensor, nano catalyst, self assembled monolayer researches. I can operate XPS, TEM, NMR, XRD. I can calculate the structure with Gassian, material studio. I've already can work as an independent researcher when I was an undergraduate.
