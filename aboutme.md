Hello, Iâ€™m Lei Pan, a master student at [University of Michigan](), majoring in **Chemistry**. I accomplished my undergraduate study at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I've been a member of **Chemistry Honored Program**, [Zhiyuan College](http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/goto/en). During the third year in undergradute, I went to [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) for half year as a visiting scholar. I have extensive undergraduate research experience, which is just a common step to my academic dream.

### A short video:  If I know the end of my life.

I just want to show my media skills. This MAD are made from still pictures.


### Why me!
> *"I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me."--Ralph*

**One can only save himself.**

**Background of background**:<br>
* My parents have never imagined their daughter would enter college and go abroad. What corresponds to them is to learn living skills, stay in my hometown and struggle against life. 
* Now I am among the top students in China. "Why am I here?" I replied "At every turning point, I chose to jump at the chance, driven by my adventurous inherent." More, I'm afraid I'm just pretending someone who is excellent. 

**Common background stories**:<br>
* I solved a 3\*3\*3 Rubik's Cube without any solution guide when I was ten years old. 
* I read literary works for 5 hours per week. My favorite writers are Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, Stefan Zweig, George Owell.
* I construct a database to record piece information. Now it has over 320,000 words, varying from professional experiments to coding, even including origami. 
* I acquire fundamental lab skills in organic chemistry, biosensor, nano catalyst, self assembled monolayer researches. I can operate XPS, TEM, NMR, XRD. I can calculate the structure with Gassian, material studio. I've already can work as an independent researcher when I was an undergraduate.
