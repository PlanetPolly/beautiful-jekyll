I’m “Polly” Lei Pan, (Chinese: ), now a senior undergrad in **Chemistry** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am a **research intern** at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/). I am a member of **Chemistry Honored Class**, [Zhiyuan College](http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/goto/en)

### My calling
> *"I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me."--Ralph*

I required myself to define "me" here. No matter how concise keywords will appear, I'd like to shape myself by telling 3 things I attempted to do. 

**The first attempt**:<br>
When I was five, my parents probably never thought that their daughter would enter college, go abroad and do research. What corresponds to their situation is to learn living skills, stay in the hometown and struggle against life. Quite dissimilar! All the differences happened smoothly in my growth. Compared to the starting point, my present status brings a trace of surprise.

Now I am among the top students in China. "Why are you here?" I replied "At every turning point, I chose to jump at the chance, driven by my adventurous inherent.

**The second attempt**:<br>
I was gifted a 3*3*3 Rubik's Cube, yet without any solving guide (not to mention the Internet). The result is that a 10-year-old kid studied the cube in her bedroom from the midday. At that time, the little girl truly grasped some rudimentary notions. 

1. The Rubik's cube is highly symmetrical, but solving it cannot perform symmetrically. 
2. I need one cardinal point as well as a basic face. To avoid affecting what has existed, it's better to simplify the steps. 
3. I found after several operations, the total moves are fixed. 

And such a profound idea came into my mind that I even deem it's proud now----to instantly replace the stickers. I can put the target stickers to replace these positions that will change, and at last just counteract the first operation. The logic works its sweet magics.

The little girl succeeded, in her unique solution. A sense of accomplishment rooted in mind and would never fade. In this little toy, I found something defines me.

I enjoy performing in such a way that's not relied on any external paradigm, to create  my own way. My first making special poster was created from scratch in a week. My first video according a music experience has thousands of clicks in 2 weeks on the website. In an entrepreneurship course I acted as a leader in one interdisciplinary project - mutual learning assistant innovatively through an app Wechat -with initial engagement more than 50 people, 100% satisfaction feedbacks. What's more, now I am an online intern of the Chinese version Scientific American. Science is spread under my pen. 

I construct a database to record those things. Now it has over 120,000 words, varying from chemical experiments to computer software. Those fragments of thoughts show the most real abilities after extirpating all kinds of skills.

**The third important attempt**:<br/>
Choose to do research. From the beginning, I hold the same mind as Spiderman who take the big responsibility coming with "enormous power". I always show up in the lab right after busy classes. In the lab, without personal desk, I just work with my data in the resting conference room. I work very hard, but endeavors are the bottom line in academic areas, the least worth mentioning. 

A keen mind is what I cherish most. All the elements of the Periodic Table, like stickers of Rubik's Cube, already exist and are constrained by acquiescent rules, The researcher's responsibility is to follow those principles finding their suitable places instead of creating something from scratch. Now I am writing an English paper in my capacity as the main author, hoping to publish it before my graduation.

Now I call give some key words from these attempts: FIND MY OWN WAY, ADVENTROUS ENOUGH and ADMIRE THINGS IN HEART.
