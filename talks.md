Some people have hobbies like camping, beer brewing, or board games. I like to taste all the areas that whet my appetite. Itâ€™s how I learn and how I like to play.

Here's what I've done so far. Some thoughts worth share.

**How to Get What You Want**

Published a short primer for ambitious people how they can get what they want in life. Reached #2 on Amazon in the Applied Psychology category. [Available in PDF, Kindle, and Audiobook](http://thewantbook.com/)

**Lessons Learned**

A small-group lightning talk event I co-organized focused on hard-earned wisdom from women leaders in November 2014. [Read about it.](https://www.jasonshen.com/2014/high-stakes-lessons-learned-organizing-womens-speaker-event/)

**WeChat Official Account: Surpass Union**

A podcast I co-hosted with Sarah Allen in winter of 2013 on making innovation work in software, business, and life. We covered tech trends, blogging as a technical skill, and the future of education.
