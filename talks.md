* Formation and reductive stability of mixed self-assembled monolayers on gold 
* Abstract: The discovery of reductively-stable self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on transition metal electrodes will enable new ways to study tethered discrete molecular electrocatalysts. Developing reductively-stable SAMs requires further understanding of reductive desorption, especially as we move from pure alkanethiol SAMs on Au towards mixed thiol systems on other metal surfaces. It is well-known that van der Waals forces play a large role in the electrochemical stability of SAMs, but less is known about how terminal functional groups affect the reductive stability of mixed SAMs with different surface concentrations and functionalization. In this work, two different mixed SAM systems were studied: chloro-decanethiol with a decanethiol diluent, and ferrocene-terminated azido-undecanethiol with a decanethiol diluent. In the Cl-thiol/decanethiol system, XPS was used to quantify the composition of the metal surface before and after reductive desorption. In the ferrocene-terminated system, the ferrocene-tagged thiol acts as a “redox probe” for measuring SAM coverage after desorption from applied constant potentials. Reductive stability was explored as a function of ferrocene coverage and SAM solubility in the electrolyte. Surface-selective polarization modulation IR reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) was used to evaluate SAM packing and monitor the chemical transformation of the terminal groups of the mixed SAMs. Desorption isotherms from coverage dependence on applied constant potentials were compared to traditional cyclic voltammetry.  Insights from measuring reductive desorption on these model systems will be applied in measuring the reductive stability on other transition metals (Ni, Cu) where traditional cyclic voltammetry fails to provide direct evidence of reductive desorption.
